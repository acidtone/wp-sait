# Assignment 2: Custom/Child Theme Group Project
## Purpose
This task helps you become more familiar with the fundamentals of WordPress by installing a new instance of WordPress on a remote server, creating pages, posts, a menu(s), users, and adding themes and plugins.

A second purpose of this task is to get practice working with a team –learning how to split up the responsibilities for a project and ensure all the requirements are covered across a larger website implementation of WordPress.

## Due Date
Your team will present your website to the rest of the class and the instructor during the afternoon of Day 5 (monday, November 18). Presentations begin at 1:30pm.

## Directions
A potential client is looking for a new web site.  The current site they have is an old design and not responsive. 

- Use the text from the current site for content in the site map.  Try and get as much of the site map completed and working as you can.
- Have a menu on each page of the site that displays all the pages created with the hierarchy of the site map.
- Have links and icons to social media.
- Create and implement a favicon for the site.
- Be prepared to answer questions about the justification for your design (why you used the design you did and how elements of the design relate specifically to your potential client
- Delegate tasks strategically based on strengths and weaknesses of your team.  Create users in WordPress for each member of the team and ensure that they all have a part to play in creating the site in WordPress.
