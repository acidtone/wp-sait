*if wordpress is capable of this, for each of the 5 sections listed above, their respective sections can all be included on one page. For example on the "About MacEwan" page, there can be a nav at the top of the page, with links to the "Our Campuses", "Our Story", and "Our Priorities" sections further down the page. Instead of each section having its own page.*
