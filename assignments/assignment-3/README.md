# Assignment 3
## Purpose
This task helps you become more familiar with the fundamentals of Jekyll by working with a GH Pages hosted site. You will be creating/configuring a number of common blog/cms features such as pages, posts, dynamic navigation, items (with collections) and plugins.

## Due
Wednesday, November 27 @ 11:59pm 

## Worth
35% of your Final Mark for the course

## Directions
Using the Jekyll framework, you will be generating a static website that is either:

- your own portfolio site
- a hypothetical client site for a business owner of your choice

Use your own unique content where possible. Place holder content is permissible with proper attribution and integration into your project. 

Lorem ipsum text and lorem picsum placeholder images cannot be used for this assignment. Adapt existing, openly licensed content for your design and use static images (can be remotely hosted) when practical.

You may use any officially supported [GH Pages theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/).
