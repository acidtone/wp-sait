# Assignment 4: CMS Group Project
## Purpose 
You should use this task to reinforce everything you have learned in your WebDev course to date. Leverage what you’ve learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, PhotoShop, CMS and your other courses to make a fully functional website for the City of GP using a Content Management System running on a remote server in the cloud. Install WordPress on the remote server, and create pages, posts, menu(s), users, and add other required functionality.

A second purpose of this task is to get practice working with a team – learning how to split up the responsibilities for a project and ensure all the requirements are covered across a larger website CMS implementation.

## Due
Your team will present your website to the rest of the class and the instructor during the afternoon of Day 7 (Wednesday, November 20).

## Directions
See individual site requirements for specific deliverables.

- Use the text from the current site for content in these pages
above. Try and get as much of the site map completed and working as you can.
- Have a menu on each page of the site that displays all the pages created with the hierarchy of the site map in question.
- Have links and icons to social media.
- Create and implement a favicon for the site.
- Be prepared to answer questions about the justification for your design.
- In your presentation, contrast and compare your site with the old website and sell us on why your design is better.
- Delegate tasks strategically based on strengths and weaknesses of your team. Create users in the CMS for each member of the team and ensure that they all have a part to play in creating the site.
- Create a custom CMS design theme for the website. Base your custom theme on the Naked theme.
