## Directions
Canada Olympic Park is looking for a new web site design. The current site they have is an older design and not responsive.

They have the following requirements for their proof of concept:
- design a website that would encourage people utilize the TNRD’s Library System. It has to have an ‘inviting’ look and feel. Colours and fonts are up to your discretion.
- For the sake of time, use images you find on the ​https://www.winsport.ca​ web site and elsewhere on the web.
- They would like the site map of the new site to look like this:
