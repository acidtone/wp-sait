# CCity of Grande Prairie

## Directions
The City of Grande Prairie, Alberta is looking for a new web site. Their current site is an older design and not responsive.

They have the following requirements for their proof of concept:

- design a website that would encourage people to visit and do business in the city. It has to have an ‘inviting’ look and feel. Colours and fonts are up to your discretion.
  - For the sake of time, use images you find on the ​http://www.cityofgp.com​ web site and elsewhere on the web.
- They would like the site map of the new site to look like this:
