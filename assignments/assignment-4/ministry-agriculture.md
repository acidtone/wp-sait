# Alberta Ministry of Agriculture

## Directions
Alberta’s provincial Ministry of Agriculture is looking for a new web site. The current site they have is a fairly old design and not responsive.

They have the following requirements for their proof of concept:

- design a website that would encourage people to investigate the Ministry and easily find the information they are looking for. It has to have an ‘inviting’ look and feel. Colours and fonts are up to your discretion.
- For the sake of time, use images you find on the web about the Minstry of Agriculture (or Alberta agriculture, or agriculture on the prairies) for your site

Build out the following site map:
