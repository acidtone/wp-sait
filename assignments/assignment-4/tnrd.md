## Directions
The ​Thompson-Nicola Regional District (TNRD) of British Columbia​ is looking for a new web site for their library system. The current site they have is an older design and not responsive.

They have the following requirements for their proof of concept:

- design a website that would encourage people utilize the TNRD’s Library System. It has to have an ‘inviting’ look and feel. Colours and fonts are up to your discretion.
  - For the sake of time, use images you find on the https://www.tnrl.ca/ web site and elsewhere on the web.
- They would like the site map of the new site to look like this:
